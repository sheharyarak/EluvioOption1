Option 1 - Core Software Engineering

In this problem, we would like your program to find the longest strand of bytes that exists in at least two files. Your program should report which file names contain the strand and the byte offset where the strand occurs in each file. Details are in the readme within this google drive folder, along with the input files:

You may write your solution in any programming language you like, but please note that performance matters!

## Problem
Given a large number of binary files, write a program that finds the
longest strand of bytes that is identical between two or more files

Use the test set attached (files sample.*)

The program should display:
- the length of the strand
- the file names where the largest strand appears
- the offset where the strand appears in each file
